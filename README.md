# Excel to JSON Converter for Flutter Localization

A powerful cross-platform tool (Android, Windows, Web, macOS, Linux, iOS) designed to streamline the Flutter localization workflow. It converts Excel spreadsheets containing translations into the JSON format required by Flutter's localization systems (like `easy_localization` or the native `flutter_localizations`).

## 🚀 Features

*   **Excel to JSON Conversion**: Takes an `.xlsx` file and generates individual `.json` files for each language column.
*   **Drag & Drop Support**: Simply drag your Excel file onto the app window to start the process.
*   **Multi-Platform**: Works seamlessly on Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux), Web, and Mobile (Android, iOS).
*   **Open Source**: Contribute and improve the tool!

This app was made to make the localizations exporting much easier. All you need is an EXCEL file of your app localizations with a specified format.

You can use the following example file as a template. It demonstrates the required structure with keys in the first column and language codes in the header:
